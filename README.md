 # JavaScript Advanced Functions: Introduction to Context

## Learning Goals

- Define the term "record"
- Define the term "record-oriented programming"

## Introduction

Let's take a moment to appreciate where we are. We've reviewed the basic use
and creation of functions. We've applied these skills in the context of
collection-processing methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `forEach`. We're now
ready to face one of the (infamously) most-challenging parts of JavaScript:
working with execution context. We're going to start this sequence of lessons
off by defining five key terms. Each will be addressed in depth elsewhere, but
we want to give you a survey first so you can say "Oh, this is important" when
you see the terms.

**Definitions**

1. Execution Context: When JavaScript functions run, they have an associated
   JavaScript `Object` that goes along with them which they can access by the
   keyword `this`.
2. `this`: Inside a function, `this` is the `Object` that represents the
   function's execution context
3. `call`: This is a method _on a function_ that calls the function, just like
   `()`. You provide a new execution context as the first argument,
   traditionally called `thisArg`, and the arguments you want to send to the
   function after the `thisArg`. An invocation of `call` looks like:
   `Calculator.sum.call(multilingualMessages, 1, 2)`
4. `apply`: This is a method _on a function_ that calls the function, just like
   `()`. You provide a new execution context as the first argument,
   traditionally called `thisArg`, and the arguments you want to send to the
   function ***as an `Array`*** after the `thisArg`. An invocation of `apply`
   looks like: `Calculator.sum.apply(multilingualMessages, [1, 2])`
5. `bind`: This method returns _a copy_ of the function but with the execution
   context "set" to the argument that's passed to `bind`. It looks like this:
   `sayHello.bind(greenFrog)("Hello") //=> "Mr. GreenFrog says *Hello* to you all."`

Printing up these definitions is what _most_ JavaScript documentation does.
People accept these as truth and shrug and muddle their way through living in a
state of fear when they write in JavaScript &mdash; but that won't be you!

In this lab, we're going to practice what we've already learned about
JavaScript to build a time-card application, guided by tests. This application
is an example of a "record-oriented" application, a term we'll explain below.
Once we have a working application, we'll show how execution context, `this`,
`call`, `apply` and `bind` can DRY up our code.

With these capabilities, we hope you'll learn to love functions even more
&mdash; maybe even as much as JavaScript does!

## Define the Term "Record"

Back in the old days (the 1960s and earlier) computers didn't have much memory.
Records were stored on, if you can even believe this, small paper cards called
punch-cards. They looked like this:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Used_Punchcard_%285151286161%29.jpg/800px-Used_Punchcard_%285151286161%29.jpg" alt="Image of a punched card, used in early computers" />

These cards, or "records," often had information on them in "fields." In the
`first_name` field, you'd find a first name, etc... So when a business needed to
figure out how much to pay each person for a week's work, something like the
following would happen:

- Load up all the employees' cards into a tray
- Feed the tray of cards into the computer
- The computer would read in each card and calculate the hours worked for the week per card
- The computer would emit a new card with all the old data but this card would have a new field 
  added called something like `wagesPaidInWeek33OfYear: 550`
- The computer would also print out a table of the employee name and the amount owed

> **ASIDE**: Come to think of it, iterating over a collection, performing a
> transformation and emitting a new collection where every element has been
> transformed sounds an _awful_ lot like `map` to us.

Then, the emitted pay ledger could be taken to the payroll department and the
appropriate person could write (Write! With their hands! Using a pen and ink!)
out paychecks to the employees.

Here's another use. If the executive team needed to know how much payroll cost
the company in a given week, they'd (you guessed it!) load up all those punch
cards in a tray and run them through a different program that calculated a
total.

> **ASIDE**: Come to think of it, iterating over a collection, performing an
> evaluation on each element and emitting a new value based on those elements
> sounds an _awful_ lot like `reduce` to us.

Ultimately, the "punch card" was an intermediate step between paper records and
digital records. But it was during the punch-card era that computing really got
big, so a _lot_ of our ways of thinking about programming started by thinking
about "records."

## Define the Term "Record-Oriented Programming"

[Record-oriented programming][rop] is a style of programming based on finding
records and processing them so that they're updated (`map`-like) or so that
their information is aggregated (`reduce`-like). "Record-oriented" isn't a
buzzword that we hear used very much, but for these next few lessons, we'll use
it. Ask any programmer who's worked in large scale billing (phone companies,
insurers, etc.) or at a university (50,000 grade point averages), and you can
bet they'll understand what the term means, though.

The amazing thing is that in the 21st century this style of programming is back
in vogue! We're not using punch cards, but the ability to spin up hundreds of
little computers in a cloud, hand them each a bundle of records, and get
answers back and process the answers are records is _cutting-edge!_

In fact, a program to do `map` and `reduce` operations at scale on a cloud was
standardized in the 2000s. Guess what it's called? [`mapReduce`][mapreduce]
&mdash; and you should know why. It was pioneered and advanced as part of the
secret sauce that made a small little company from Mountain View, California
called Google become the giant it is today. Today you can use it under the
name of [Apache Hadoop][Hadoop]

The "Go" programming language is built around building and processing records
at scale. Record-Oriented Programming is not likely to go away any time soon.
Maybe it'll be the hot job posting buzzword any minute now!

## Lab

In this lab, we're going to build a time-card and payroll application using the
record-oriented approach.

The tests guide you to implementing a time card system: when someone enters the
company's state of the art technical office, the employee has to insert their
card in a time-clock which will record the time they came in. When it's time to
leave, the employee will "punch out."

For simplicity's sake, we'll make these assumptions:

1. Assume that employees always check-in **and** check-out.
2. Assume employees always check-in and out on the hour
3. The time is represented on a 24-hour clock (1300 is 1:00 pm); this keeps the
   math easier and is the standard in most of the world
4. When timestamps are needed, they will be provided as `String`s in the form:
   `"YYYY-MM-DD 800"` or `"YYYY-MM-DD 1800"` e.g. `"2018-01-01 2300"`
5. Employees will never work across days i.e. in at `2200` and out at `0400` the
   next day.

The lab tests will guide you toward a solution. Keep in mind, the goal is to
understand how to "grow" an application in "record-oriented" fashion in
JavaScript, _as well_ as pass the lab. Make sure you're learning about this app
design while you pass the solutions. When you encounter a failing test, look at
how the test is calling the function that's missing or failing: how did it call
the function, what arguments did it pass? What kind of thing did it expect
back?

Take advantage of your collection-processing strengths that you trained up over
the last few lessons.

## Extending the Challenge

If you have the time, you can learn more about JavaScript and remove the
simplifying assumptions we wrote above. You can expand your learning by:

- Raise an exception if a `timeIn` is found without a matching `timeOut`
  - [Exception Handling in JavaScript][error]
- Figure out how to turn a time stamp into a construct that allows for you to
  handle across day and non-o'clock times
  - [Date Class Documentation][date]
- Raise errors if the time stamp is in an invalid format

While the bar set by the tests is at one level, you can turn this into a robust
application, if you so desire!

Put your code in `index.js`.

While you will want to be guided by the tests, you will implement the following
functions. To make the tests easier to read, we've provided the _signatures_ of
the functions.

A function _signature_ is the function name, the arguments it expects, and what
the function returns.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! At the end of this lab, you should have built several
incredibly simple functions that leveraged `map` and `reduce` to transform and
aggregate data. Take a look at your code and see where you might be repeating
yourself. Finding these repetitions will be where we can bring in the
innovation of execution context. We'll learn how this can DRY up our code using
execution contexts in the next lesson.

It's also worth your time to take a look at the tests in `test/indexTest.js`.
Because of this application's design, it's incredibly easy to test the
functions which drive the application. Some programmers consider this style of
programming to be optimal for the ease of testing and simplicity of code.
